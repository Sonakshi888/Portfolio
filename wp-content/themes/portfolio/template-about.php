            <p id="para2">I have pursued Bachelor's in Commerce (2019-22) with ~75%. Being a Commerce student, I've developed interest in IT Sector UI/UX Designing. I found myself being involved and dedicated towards web designing. I've always admired how thoughtful design has the power to change our world. Whether it's through simplifying one interaction or giving users an opportunity to view things through a new lens, I love working on projects that makes people happy and satisfied.</p>
            <p id="para3">In the past few years, I found myself learning commerce and accounting. But, there was always a force of attraction towards designing. So, I made my mind to serve as a UI/UX designer.</p>
